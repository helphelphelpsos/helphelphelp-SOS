Need help from geeks

Hello everyone

This is a near 70 years old lady, who comes from China.
Do really need your help to help me to get back my money from the cheater.

The case is very simple:
One day, a guy (my wehcat friend, who is a "teacher" of how to operate in China stock market) invite me into a whechat group.
In this group, most of them are cheaters, 4 of them are "teacher", teach people of Chinese stocks selection and operation.
Some of them are pretend to be virtual coin buyers.

One day, one of the teacher said, that the stock is hard to earn money, you guys could switch to virtual coin.
So they introduce me a customer supporter(who is also a cheater) from "币胜" (the cheater's platform for virtual coin) on the wechat.
First, the customer supporter help me create a account of huobi (a real virtual coin exchange market), and also help me how to buy in the virtual coins named "USDT".
Everything goes well till now, that is to say, I pay money to buy the regular virtual coins - USDT, at huobi. All the USDT are in my huobi account.

But the cheater's target is not help you to buy USDT at huobi.
His target is transfer all your USDT to another platform -- "币胜"。
The customer supporter then ask me to transfer all my USDT to the "币胜" platform, and change all the USDT to DFM.
Then all the DFM is frozen, and can't transfer back to my huobi account.
The total money i use for the USDT is 69300 RMB ($10660)

But I have very little info about the cheater.
There are very large poeple is cheat by this platform: transfer their USDT out, switch to DFM, but could no get back, them lost all the money.
